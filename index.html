                <h3>Work and Travel (Summer 2024)</h3>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 2024, I worked as a photographer at Deluxe Photo in Atlantic City for nearly three months. My job involved capturing<br>
                    moments of restaurant guests and offering them personalized photos. Instead of working in a single restaurant, I rotated between four different venues,<br>
                    adapting to new environments and schedules.<br>
                    This experience allowed me to meet countless people from different cultures, improve my English, and most importantly, step out of my comfort zone. I made <br>
                    the decision to go to the U.S. alone, without any friends, which gave me the opportunity to discover myself while embracing new experiences.<br>
                    After my work period, I traveled to Philadelphia, Miami, and finally New York, making unforgettable memories. It was an incredible experience,<br>
                    and I will be sharing some of my favorite moments from this journey through photos!
